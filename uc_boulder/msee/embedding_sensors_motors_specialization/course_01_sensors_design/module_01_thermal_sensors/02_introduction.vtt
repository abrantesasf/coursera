00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
Okay people, now it's time to get serious.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.960
Let's have a show of hands here.

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.700
Who here thinks that he or she is an absolute expert on sensors and actuators?

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.545
I don't see any hands up, but that's good.

5
00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:19.365
Because if there were experts in the audience,

6
00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:24.035
I would wonder why you are wasting your time on a Coursera class.

7
00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:28.725
In course one of our specialization on embedding sensors and actuators,

8
00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:31.750
we will take a deep dive into temperature sensors.

9
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.025
The granddaddy of all sensors.

10
00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:37.134
Its history dates back to the 18th century

11
00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:40.555
when guys named Fahrenheit and Celsius were around.

12
00:00:40.555 --> 00:00:45.385
We will get you started with your piece of development kit both hardware and software.

13
00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:48.150
There will be a few labs for you to do on schematics,

14
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.725
amplifiers, wiring, and adding sensors to the kit.

15
00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:53.965
Then, we'll explain rotary sensors.

16
00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:56.555
You'll do some lab work with those sensors.

17
00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:59.625
Last, will tackle amplifiers,

18
00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:02.695
circuit diagrams, derivation of grade equations,

19
00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.615
noise issues and spec sheets.

20
00:01:04.615 --> 00:01:08.995
You need expertise on amplifiers to work with sensors because there's

21
00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:13.620
no such thing as a sensor circuit that doesn't have an amplifier.

22
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.400
My partner Jim and I believe that online education should be just as

23
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.065
rigorous as attending an upper class or graduate level engineering class in person.

24
00:01:22.065 --> 00:01:28.060
Learning about sensors and actuators requires in-depth study of analog electronics.

25
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.215
Please review material you learned on this subject if you are having trouble keeping up.

26
00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:36.960
Every module will have reading assignments which you can

27
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.675
download from the URL's listed in the class information.

28
00:01:40.675 --> 00:01:45.945
There will be lab assignments for you to perform and online quizzes for you to take.

29
00:01:45.945 --> 00:01:48.445
In module one of course one,

30
00:01:48.445 --> 00:01:52.530
we will give you a high level overview of sensors and actuators as well

31
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.425
as the analog and digital interfaces that connect them to a digital circuit.

32
00:01:57.425 --> 00:02:02.470
Then, we will review the principles of operation and circuits for Thermocouples.

33
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.470
RTD's and Thermistors.
