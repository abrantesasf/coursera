1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Sensors are in most electronics products these days.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.315
They're driving a technology revolution called,

3
00:00:07.315 --> 00:00:10.150
"The Internet of Things."

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.370
Process sensors are used in petrochemical,

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.350
pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries to measure and

6
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.665
control the chemical reactions needed to create these important raw materials.

7
00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:27.850
Position sensors are found in vehicles and aircrafts.

8
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.820
Motion sensors are used there as well as in smartphones and security systems.

9
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.820
And by the way, turn your phone off.

10
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.245
Ergonomic sensors are found in tablets, PCs, and phones.

11
00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:46.648
Chemical sensors protect us from fire and toxic vapor hazards.

12
00:00:46.648 --> 00:00:52.090
And Electrical sensors are found in lab instruments and security systems.

13
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.310
Let's take a deeper look about how sensors are used in your smartphone.

14
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.310
Have you ever wondered how this phone shuts down if you

15
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.145
leave it sitting in the sun on a hot summer day?

16
00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:07.075
That's because the thermistor inside this phone

17
00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:11.307
senses that the internal circuits may overheat soon.

18
00:01:11.307 --> 00:01:18.010
It sends a signal to the microprocessor to shut down this phone before it's too late.

19
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.355
Now, let's take a look at Google Maps. Google Maps.

20
00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:25.085
Google Maps. It keeps us from getting lost, doesn't it?

21
00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:29.360
It's that GPS sensor in our phones that enables this little app.

22
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.375
Proximity sensors placed by the earpiece of your phone telling it when you're on a call.

23
00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:37.170
Hello, hello, hello.

24
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.830
The phone saves battery power by turning off the screen.

25
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.955
The gyroscope enables this compass app,

26
00:01:44.955 --> 00:01:51.775
and a capacitive sensor on the touchscreen senses when your finger is touching an icon.

27
00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:57.514
A light sensor adjusts the screen brightness here for ambient light levels.

28
00:01:57.514 --> 00:02:00.580
And there is a battery sensor in here to correlate

29
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.550
the charge level in the battery to present of life left on a phone.

30
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.075
Dozens of sensors are used in modern automobiles.

31
00:02:10.075 --> 00:02:14.350
Temperature sensors monitor the combustion process in the engine,

32
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.465
the cooling process in the radiator and your comfort level in the cabin.

33
00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:25.225
Pressure sensors make sure you have sufficient oil to lubricate

34
00:02:25.225 --> 00:02:28.210
those pistons and proper air levels in

35
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.755
the tires to make those wheels go around and you drive safely.

36
00:02:32.755 --> 00:02:38.830
A flow sensor makes sure you have sufficient air intake to combust the gasoline,

37
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.630
that's of course if it's a gasoline engine.

38
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.240
Position sensors monitor engine throttle,

39
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.287
crank and camshaft angles,

40
00:02:47.287 --> 00:02:52.395
and radar detectors are critical features of all autonomous vehicle software.

41
00:02:52.395 --> 00:02:57.915
Airbags know when a collision is imminent from the accelerometer inside.

42
00:02:57.915 --> 00:03:00.400
And dashboard touch screens, well,

43
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.125
they have capacitive sensors too.

44
00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:09.110
An oxygen sensor monitors the intake to the combustion reaction in the engine.

45
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.410
And the oxygen and hydrogen sensors are used in

46
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.635
experimental fuel cells for battery operated cars.

47
00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:19.310
A battery sensor is an essential element

48
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.160
of all cars whether gasoline or battery operated.

49
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.775
Four classes of actuators are used in your automobiles,

50
00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:31.750
production equipment, and appliances in your home.

51
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.070
First, hydraulic sensors, or hydraulic actuators I should say,

52
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.300
use pressure from highly compressed oil to push large cylinders

53
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.670
inside construction equipment such as lifts, cranes, and excavators.

54
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.260
They're characterized by slow speed of response due to the long time it

55
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.945
takes to compressed oil and the high gear ratios in the mechanisms that deploy them.

56
00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:59.645
Pneumatic actuators give a faster speed of

57
00:03:59.645 --> 00:04:04.385
response due to a faster compression of air versus oil.

58
00:04:04.385 --> 00:04:08.045
They're most commonly found in production assembly equipment.

59
00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:09.730
The downside is they're

60
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.341
really noisy and small leaks in these seals lead to large losses in compression.

61
00:04:16.341 --> 00:04:21.790
Electrical motors convert electrical energy to rotary motion.

62
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.730
They are directly interfaced with sensors within

63
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.380
hardware and will be used extensively in our course.

64
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.200
Mechanical actuators such as gears,

65
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.988
and belts, and lead screws,

66
00:04:33.988 --> 00:04:38.980
either they boost up the torque or they convert the rotary motion to linear motion.

67
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.295
Electrical actuators come in three flavors.

68
00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:48.715
A stepper motor has multiple coils organized in phases.

69
00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:52.120
Energizing the coils sequentially allows

70
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.355
the stepper motor to rotate in very precise steps.

71
00:04:56.355 --> 00:05:03.980
A brushed DC motor has a coil that generates a magnetic field around that armature.

72
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.220
One side of that armature is repelled by the north pole of a magnet located

73
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.950
in the motor casing while the other side is attracted to the south pole of that magnet.

74
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:20.620
The opposing forces cause the armature to rotate in one direction.

75
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.305
As the armature rotates in that direction,

76
00:05:23.305 --> 00:05:26.170
the torque eventually goes to zero and

77
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.610
the magnetic field of the armature attracts to the north and south poles.

78
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.486
Reversing current to the armature causes that side to be repelled by the south pole,

79
00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:40.690
but attracted to the north pole and reversing

80
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.080
current exactly on that half cycle creates your continuous rotation.

81
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.800
The brushes in the brushed DC motors

82
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.442
wear rapidly and must be replaced at frequent intervals.

83
00:05:54.442 --> 00:05:58.420
Brushless DC motors resolved this issue by

84
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.430
using permanent magnets rotating around a fixed armature.

85
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.850
An electronic controller switches the phase to

86
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.720
the windings allowing rotation within the motor.

87
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.940
Let's recap here.

88
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.180
We discussed the major categories of sensors and

89
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.615
actuators that we will feature in this specialization.

90
00:06:20.615 --> 00:06:24.000
Now in the next video, Jim,

91
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.340
will give you an overview of the analog and digital interfaces that

92
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.960
allow you to integrate sensors and actuators into embedded systems.
