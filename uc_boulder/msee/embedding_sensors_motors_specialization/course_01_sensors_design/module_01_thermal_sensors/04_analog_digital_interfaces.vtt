00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Most things we want to
measure, for example,

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.330
temperature or pressure,
are continuously varying.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.670
The sensor data must
be converted to

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.530
a digital format
before it can be

5
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.095
interpreted by a microprocessor.

6
00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:16.170
Applying power to a
sensor so that it

7
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.205
produces a usable output
is called excitation.

8
00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:23.250
Analog circuitry excites filters

9
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.040
and amplifies the
raw sensor signal,

10
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.485
a process called
signal conditioning.

11
00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:30.780
Once processed in this way,

12
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.135
the signal is sent to an ADC,

13
00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:35.985
short for analog-to-digital
converter.

14
00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:38.940
The output of the
ADC is typically 8,

15
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.760
12, 16, or 24 bits.

16
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.745
Data from an ADC is usually
converted to a serial format,

17
00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:50.995
such as I2C, SPI or RS-232.

18
00:00:50.995 --> 00:00:54.185
Certain sensors,
humidity in particular,

19
00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:56.390
incorporate the analog front end

20
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.085
on a single chip solution,

21
00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:00.110
producing a digital output

22
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.515
easily connected to
a microprocessor.

23
00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:06.875
The raw output of most sensors

24
00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:09.985
is easily corrupted, hence,

25
00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:12.260
signal conditioning circuitry is

26
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.275
located very close
to the sensor,

27
00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:19.655
helping to shield against
external interference.

28
00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:23.540
Once converted, the digital
signal can easily be

29
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.650
transmitted over great
distances with minimal error.

30
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.420
It is helpful to use

31
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.105
a microcontroller
for sensor systems.

32
00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:34.280
This device consists of

33
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.930
a microprocessor with

34
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.885
a built-in analog-to-digital
converter.

35
00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:41.420
In this course, you'll be using

36
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.005
the Cypress PSoC series
of microcontrollers.

37
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:49.160
This microcontroller also
contains amplifiers,

38
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.990
multiplexers, comparators,

39
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.380
timers, counters,
and shift registers.

40
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.660
It minimizes the number of

41
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.160
discrete components between

42
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.590
the sensor and the
microcontroller.

43
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.205
It is a hardware
programmable part.

44
00:02:03.205 --> 00:02:05.735
You design electronic circuits

45
00:02:05.735 --> 00:02:10.085
implemented as real hardware
inside the PSoC chip.

46
00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:12.620
The hardware then interacts with

47
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.620
the code you write in
a seamless manner.

48
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.450
The design environment for

49
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.114
this part is called
PSoC creator,

50
00:02:20.114 --> 00:02:22.100
and includes schematic capture

51
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.965
in addition to a code editor.

52
00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:27.980
In addition, a handful
of inexpensive sensors

53
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.420
and actuators will be made

54
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.820
available for you to
purchase for this course,

55
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.695
and future ones that are
part of the specializations.

56
00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:38.100
Normally, you would need

57
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.800
an expensive bench-top
digital oscilloscope

58
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.315
to take sensor readings,

59
00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:45.070
such as this one from Agilent.

60
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.440
You may use this
type of scope if you

61
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.410
have access to one
at work or school.

62
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.090
However, for this class,

63
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.035
you may also purchase a much
lower cost oscilloscope,

64
00:02:57.035 --> 00:02:59.855
that you can connect
to your laptop PC.

65
00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:01.760
We give you some suggestions of

66
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.990
devices to purchase in
the course syllabus.

67
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.705
We hope you share our
enthusiasm for building things.

68
00:03:08.705 --> 00:03:11.580
It's the best way to learn.
