00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.940
Hi students. In this video,

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.500
we're going to be
talking more about

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.540
the Linux Command Line
and go over some basic,

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.040
common Linux utilities that

5
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.440
you'll be using heavily
in this course.

6
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.350
First of all, why would we
want to use the command line?

7
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.685
So you might say, "Well,

8
00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:16.860
I just installed Ubuntu
and I logged in,

9
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.080
it's got this fancy,
nice graphical UI,

10
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.625
why don't I just use that?"

11
00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:22.200
Well, you definitely can,

12
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.570
and you should absolutely use

13
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.240
the graphical UI especially

14
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.535
if that makes it easy
for you starting out.

15
00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:30.930
However, a lot of the work

16
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.130
that we're going to
do in this course

17
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.600
is going to be talking about
automation and scripting.

18
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.960
How to make things
happen automatically

19
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.850
based on a list of instructions

20
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.170
that we're going to
write into a script.

21
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.570
A lot of that is going to be

22
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.020
interacting with the terminal.

23
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.060
You're going to need to get

24
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.890
comfortable with the
terminal as a part

25
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.480
of completing the assignments

26
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.490
and the coursework
for this course.

27
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.140
Some other reasons to
learn the command line is

28
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.260
because it is the only thing
that every Linux system has.

29
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.970
It's the only common thing

30
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.965
that you'll find across
all Linux systems.

31
00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:03.715
Desktop distributions are going
to be slightly different.

32
00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:06.470
Sometimes in recovery
scenarios, for instance,

33
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.890
you might not even have access
to a desktop environment.

34
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.960
If you think about the

35
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.380
embedded devices that
we're going to work on,

36
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.190
you might not have any kind
of HDMI or video output.

37
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.300
It might be that the only real
way you can interact with

38
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.010
the devices is through a
command-line terminal.

39
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.565
Even if you normally would have

40
00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:32.240
a UI type of environment
to work with,

41
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.700
in Linux, often when
you have a problem,

42
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.740
you might not have the
option to use the UI.

43
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.990
The problem might happen
early in a boot sequence

44
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.720
before you're able to
load a UI, for instance.

45
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.170
Again, command line becomes
the least common denominator

46
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.740
of what's available at

47
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.350
a given point anytime
we're booting the system.

48
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.570
It's often just the
easiest, fastest,

49
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.830
and the most reliable way to
remotely access the system.

50
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.060
There's other ways to set up so

51
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.400
that you can get access
to the full UI remotely.

52
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.070
But it becomes a lot
faster if you get used to

53
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.475
using the command line
to do those tests.

54
00:02:10.475 --> 00:02:12.500
Talking a little bit about some

55
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.585
really common Linux utilities

56
00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:16.720
that are available for I/O.

57
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.405
First one is echo.

58
00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:21.410
This allows us to
do the typical,

59
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.770
Hello World that you start
every assignment with.

60
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.130
If I say echo and then put
Hello World in quotes,

61
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.650
I simply echo the content of

62
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.410
the past back out
to the terminal.

63
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.960
There's another I/O application

64
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.270
that's really popular
and useful as cat.

65
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.535
What cat is short
for concatenate,

66
00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:44.945
which means just print out

67
00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:48.565
whatever file that I specified
out to the terminal.

68
00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:50.300
In this case, if I
have a text file

69
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.620
that's located in my directory

70
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.590
that says ECEN 5013 is awesome.

71
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.840
If I just type cat in
the name of that file,

72
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.300
it'll copy out the contents
of the file to the terminal.

73
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.350
If I want to move back and

74
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.345
forth between
different directories,

75
00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:06.860
there's a command called PWD,

76
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.915
which stands for Print
Working Directory.

77
00:03:08.915 --> 00:03:10.355
This will tell me where I'm at

78
00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:12.235
in the directory hierarchy.

79
00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:13.950
If I'm at a random command line,

80
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.030
I type PWD,

81
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.110
I can see that I'm actually

82
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.055
at home/ecen 5013
in the file system.

83
00:03:20.055 --> 00:03:22.790
Ls is also useful command that

84
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.920
lets you list the
contents of a directory.

85
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.495
If I am in my home
directory and I type Ls,

86
00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:30.950
I can see all the
different, in this case,

87
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.710
the blue list is the
directories that are

88
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.770
created in my home directory,

89
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.680
and this white example
is an example of a file.

90
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.490
To move around between
directories, I can use cd.

91
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.930
Cd plus the directory
name will move

92
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.150
me into that directory
from the terminal,

93
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.470
and then I could use Ls to list

94
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.905
the contents of that
directory, for instance.

95
00:03:53.905 --> 00:03:56.390
Mkdir could make a new directory

96
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.680
based on the name
that you specify.

97
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.275
Some other common directory
in file manipulation,

98
00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:05.030
mv is going to move.

99
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.120
So you can move files or
directories to a new location.

100
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.255
Cp is going to copy.

101
00:04:10.255 --> 00:04:12.480
In the move case,
you're going to

102
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.390
take the file out

103
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.175
of one directory, put
it in another one.

104
00:04:16.175 --> 00:04:17.930
In the copy case you're
going to make a duplicate

105
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.755
of the file from one
location to another.

106
00:04:20.755 --> 00:04:23.690
Rm is going to be removing
either a directory or

107
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.960
a file based on the file
name that you pass.

108
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.900
One other common
utility that you'll

109
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.680
use in this course is touch.

110
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.640
What touch does is just
updates a file's timestamp.

111
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.020
If the file already exists or
if the file doesn't exist,

112
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.120
it's just going to
create an empty file

113
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.780
and update the timestamp
to the current timestamp.

114
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.660
For all of these commands and

115
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.090
every command that you
deal with on the terminal,

116
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.835
there's what are
called the man pages,

117
00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:54.890
that our short for manual pages,

118
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.570
you can use to find
out more details

119
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.985
about how to use a command.

120
00:04:57.985 --> 00:05:01.160
The cp command that we
talked about before,

121
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.260
if you use man cp

122
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.165
to get more information
about that command,

123
00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:07.760
you'll see all the
different options

124
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.220
that you can pass
to the command.

125
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.970
If you read through
the description,

126
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.425
you'll see all the details about

127
00:05:12.425 --> 00:05:13.880
the specific options that

128
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.395
you can provide and
what every option does.

129
00:05:17.395 --> 00:05:23.060
The man program in the
manual references here,

130
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.370
date back to the original
Unix Programmer's Manual

131
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.705
from 1971.

132
00:05:26.705 --> 00:05:30.560
If you look at these numbers
in parentheses here,

133
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.840
these are actual
referencing chapters

134
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.000
of the Unix Programmer's Manual.

135
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.510
In this case, Chapter
1 is talking about cp,

136
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.570
and it's all of the user
commands that you can issue on

137
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.950
the terminal for
Unix-Linux based system.

138
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:53.760
Cp man is also easy
to search via Google.

139
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.430
A lot of times
rather than going to

140
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.590
the terminal and type
man, whatever I want,

141
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.380
I will just type man plus

142
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.040
the command name
directly into Google.

143
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.430
You'll pull up sites that
have man pages online.

144
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.550
This is a handy way of
referencing those and of

145
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.940
looking those up
using your web term.

146
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:22.805
Here's an example of use
of the cp command and

147
00:06:22.805 --> 00:06:25.280
looking for more
information to use

148
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.035
the cp command using
the man function.

149
00:06:30.035 --> 00:06:33.270
In this case, I changed

150
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.175
directory into my
electro 2 directory.

151
00:06:35.175 --> 00:06:37.580
Then I make a new directory
called A directory and I

152
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.690
make a sub-directory under
that called A subdir.

153
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.520
Then I'm going to
make a directory

154
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.740
that's going to be the
target of a copy command,

155
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.115
so I make A copy
target directory.

156
00:06:48.115 --> 00:06:49.680
Then I'm going to try to copy

157
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.145
A directory to A copy
target directory,

158
00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:56.705
again using the source-destination
format here for cp.

159
00:06:56.705 --> 00:07:01.670
What I'll notice is if
I run this command,

160
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.770
I get an error message
that comes back that

161
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.705
says -r not specified,

162
00:07:05.705 --> 00:07:07.355
omitting directory A directory.

163
00:07:07.355 --> 00:07:08.945
What it's telling
me here is that

164
00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:10.940
it didn't actually
copy one directory

165
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.830
to my target directory because

166
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.915
I didn't specify the -r option.

167
00:07:14.915 --> 00:07:17.060
If I go back to the screen

168
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.770
I looked at before
where I typed man

169
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.680
cp and a terminal and I pull
up the man page for cp,

170
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.910
one of the things I can look
for is the -r option for cp.

171
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.595
I can see what the
-r option does.

172
00:07:29.595 --> 00:07:32.555
In this case, it's saying
copy directories recursively.

173
00:07:32.555 --> 00:07:35.550
Because I'm trying to
copy A directory and

174
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.555
A subdirectory recursively
into my copy target,

175
00:07:38.555 --> 00:07:40.430
I'm going to need
to specify cp -r

176
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.620
as the error message suggested.

177
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.845
To fix this, I could do cp -r

178
00:07:47.845 --> 00:07:50.310
and reference the copy directory

179
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.620
into the copy target directory.

180
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.820
If I install the tree command
that I mentioned before,

181
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.910
so I can visualize the
directory tree structure.

182
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.220
Once I look under the A
copy target directory,

183
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.240
I'll see my A directory
and A subdirectory.

184
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.630
I can see that that structure

185
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.750
actually matches the structure

186
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.430
that I intended to
copying with cp.
